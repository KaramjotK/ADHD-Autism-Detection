Classification of psychiatric disorders: ADHD and Autism from Healthy Controls

Machine Learning Models used : Random Forest and Support Vector Machine
Deep Learning Models used : Model inspired from VGG-16 Architecture in addition to Squeeze and Excitation Blocks.

-Developed and fine-tuned deep learning models using 2D CNNs with multi-channel inputs (PSI, FCMap, Pearson correlation) and Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks.
-Achieved high classification accuracy upto 97% for psychiatric disorders, leveraging advanced deep learning and machine learning techniques (Random Forest, SVM) on rs-fMRI data.
-Brainstormed models, algorithms, and explored heuristics to optimize accuracy, implemented modular and functional code, and derived actionable insights for medical diagnosis.
-Conducted interdisciplinary problem-solving by integrating topological feature extraction and neuroimaging datasets to deliver scalable solutions.
